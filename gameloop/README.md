# Game Loop

This directory contains sample code shown in class for the discussion of the game loop.

To compile everything, type `make` in a terminal in this directory. After compilation, each directory will have a binary (simply called `binary`) that you can run to see the demonstration.

You will need [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to build the binaries, but you should be able to reference what you need from the source code without building anything.
